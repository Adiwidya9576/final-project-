The meeting began with a discussion of the Q3 marketing budget.
It was decided that 40% of the budget will go to digital ads, 30% to events, and 30% to social media campaigns.
The team emphasized the need for influencer partnerships and email marketing to boost engagement.
A pilot program to test new ad formats will launch next month, with results reviewed by the end of Q3.
The events team raised concerns about resource allocation for trade shows, so $10,000 was reallocated to cover costs.
The team decided to proceed with Concept B for the upcoming campaign after positive focus group feedback.
Deadlines for campaign assets were finalized: all deliverables must be submitted by July 15.
